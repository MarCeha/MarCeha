Dear Guest!

I would like to welcome You to my GitHub page.
Here im trying to show my projects completed with a help of online tutorials as well as 100% selfmade ones.

Im hoping that these files will demonstrate my experience and knowledge with programs and languages that I wish to be an expert off: Power BI, Microsoft Excel and SQL.
I know I have much to learn but every day I'm trying to add a brick to this long long road. 

I'm currently learning Power BI - my goal is to learn it to a degree that will allow me to create a well designed and smooth working raport in a relativly short time.

I hope You'll find something interesting that will convince You to message me or hire me and help me grow.
Hope to hear from You and thank You for visiting :)
